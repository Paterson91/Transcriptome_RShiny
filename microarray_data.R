#In this way we will create the vector (column) containing the probe IDs.

#Creating a pseudo-chip image
#useful for detecting spatial differences (artifacts) on the invidual arrays (so not for comparing between arrays).
#Pseudo-images are generated by fitting a probe-level model (PLM) to the data that assumes that all probes of a probe set behave the same in the different samples: 
#probes that bind well to their target should do so on all arrays, probes that bind with low affinity should do so on all arrays.

#based on weights
#Weights represent how much the original data contribute to the model: 
#outliers are strongly downweighted because they are so different from the ideal data. 
#Weights have values between 0 and 1. 
#So the smaller the weight of a probe
#-> the more the probe is not showing the typical behavior that it shows on the other arrays
#-> the more its intensity can be considered an outlier
#Creating pseudoimages based on weights is done exactly the same as in affy.

#Based on residuals
#Residuals are the second quantity used for chip pseudo-images. 
# They represent the difference between the original data and the ideal data according to the model.
# So the more a residual deviates from 0, the larger the difference between the data and the model.
#Residuals can be
#positive: the intensity of the probe is larger than the ideal value according to the model
#negative: the intensity of the probe is smaller than the ideal value according to the model
#Creating pseudoimages based on residuals is slightly different from affy:
#The type argument is used to control which of these images is drawn:
#type="resids" gives a pseudo-image of residuals
#type="pos.resids" only high positive residuals are drawn in red, while negative and near 0 residuals being drawn in white
#type="neg.resids" only extreme negative residuals are drawn in blue, while positive negative and near 0 residuals being drawn in white
#type="sign.resids" gives images where all negative residuals regardless of magnitude are indicated by blue and all positive residuals by red
